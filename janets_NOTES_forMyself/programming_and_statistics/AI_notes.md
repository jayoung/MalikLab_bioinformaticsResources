# artificial intelligence - AI / chatGPT / etc

xxx move these notes!  leave a link to the course I will likely do next and to the location of my notes

A [Nature intro article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03023-4) by Jeff Leek and others:
- different LLMs are trained on different datasets, and have different "personalities"
- for different uses, we might choose a different LLM

Acronyms:
- "LLM": large language model
- "GPT": Generative Pre-trained Transformer (a type of LLM)

LLM examples include:
- github copilot
- OpenAI chatGPT 3.5 (doesn't include training post-2021)
- OpenAI chatGPT 4   (requires subscription, Maria says it does well for R) Maria pays $20/month. Does hutch have a license? or should we get a group license?
- Bard (from google)
- Claude
- Phind (formerly known as Hello) - designed for software development
- Llama (from Meta = Facebook) 

Strengths and weaknesses
- Bard and Claude might be best for text-y things, not programming things
- Bard will admit when it doesn't know the answer
- chatGPT sometimes MAKES THINGS UP
- Phind provides links to useful sites, but sometimes directly plagiarises

Tips on using LLMs
- be patient
- queries should include what sort of output you want, provide context
- expect some back and forth. Sometimes it takes longer to ask than to just do it.
- test everything - LLMs are fallible. 

Ways to access the LLMs
- copy-paste into the LLM's web interface 
- VScode has a way
- Rstudio does it via the []`chattr` package](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2024-04-04-chat-with-llms-using-chattr/)

Maria says github copilot does well for python (older)


Dec 2024:
- Maria/Pravrutha say PerplexityAI is really good for literature search type questions (it gives citations and doesn't make stuff up)
- Maria says Claude Sonnet 3.5 is good for coding
