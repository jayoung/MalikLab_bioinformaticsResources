# Getting species trees

[TimeTree](http://timetree.org)

[phyloT](https://phylot.biobyte.de) for getting accepted species trees


# Phylogenies


## IQ-Tree

I see this used in several large-scale studies

## Treebest

[Treebest](http://treesoft.sourceforge.net/treebest.shtml) - used in Ensembl pipeline. Combines multiple tree types (nucleotide, protein, dN, dS, species tree), tries to reduce number of mismatches to species tree, infers duplication, deletion, etc.

# Phylogenetic tree display/plotting

interactive Tree Of Life [iTOL](https://itol.embl.de) has some nice-looking plotting tools

[ggtree](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ggtree/inst/doc/ggtree.html) for R
