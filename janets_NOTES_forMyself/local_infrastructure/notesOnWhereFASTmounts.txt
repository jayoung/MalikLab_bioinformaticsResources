## 2021

I'm using Go-ConnectToServer-smb://center.fhcrc.org/fh/fast/malik_h/

It mounts as /Volumes/malik_h




## before 2021

Aug 4. work computer. 

I got rid of all the links in my sidebar and started again, by using Go-ConnectToServer-smb://center.fhcrc.org/fh. That mounts as /Volumes/fh/.

ls /Volumes/fh/
economy		fast		secure		transfer

(previously I think it appeared as /Volumes/fh/ but was actually pointing to /Volumes/fh/fast/malik_h/ - now I think I need that whole path)

see script substitutetexttemp.pl to help me change paths where necessary (and then perhaps mvfiletemp.pl)
