1. update homebrew on my mac
git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow
    worked, although it was slow
brew update
    it did a LOT! but ended with:
Error: Cask 'java' is unreadable: undefined method `undent' for #<String:0x00007f8f8071c2f0>
Did you mean?  undef
               indent
               indent!

2. uninstall/reinstall java
brew uninstall --force java
rm -r "$(brew --prefix)/Caskroom/java"
sudo chown -R jayoung /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig /usr/local/share/man
brew install java

brew update
    now says I am up to date

2. install ftp on my mac
brew install inetutils

3. configure cpan, as I am getting errors that all the mirrors it tries are unavailable:
cpan
o conf urllist unshift http://www.cpan.org
o conf commit
quit

4. install cpanm
cpan App::cpanminus

5. install mysql
brew install mysql
    seems like it worked

I was having trouble with some perl stuff, so I try installing perlbrew and a different version of perl - there is advice in various places not to use the Mac's inbuilt perl: https://perlbrew.pl/Installation.html

6. install perlbrew, to help me manage different versions of perl on the mac
sudo cpan App::perlbrew
perlbrew init

echo '' >> ~/.profile
echo '# use perlbrew rather than system perl:' >> ~/.profile
echo 'source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc'  >> ~/.profile
echo ''  >> ~/.profile

7. now actually install a different version of perl - getting stuck here.
before I did used perlbrew to give me a new perl, I have v5.30.3. The current stable version of perl is 5.34.0.

I got an error if I try to install from the web using this command:
    perlbrew install perl-5.34.0
I think it's to do with our firewall. So I found two different tarballs and put them both in /Users/jayoung/perl5/perlbrew/dists/

perl-5.34.0.tar.gz came from https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/X/XS/XSAWYERX/perl-5.34.0.tar.gz
and 
perl5-5.34.0.tar.gz came from https://github.com/Perl/perl5/releases/tag/v5.34.0

then I install using this command (I am doing this from /Users/jayoung/source_codes/perl) 
perlbrew install /Users/jayoung/perl5/perlbrew/dists/perl-5.34.0.tar.gz

seems to have worked - tool a while
    perl-5.34.0 is successfully installed.
then do:
perlbrew switch perl-5.34.0

Now:
which perl 
/Users/jayoung/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.34.0/bin/perl
perl -v shows 5.34.0


8. install cpanm
cpan App::cpanminus
   (it went into /Users/jayoung/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.34.0/bin/cpanm)


9. install some prereqs for DBD::mysql that wouldn't install on their own
   I had to install DBI with cpan instead of cpanm. cpan asked for my password:
cpan
install DBI


cpanm --force ExtUtils::MakeMaker
! Installing ExtUtils::MakeMaker failed. See /Users/jayoung/.cpanm/work/1640047297.31513/build.log for details. Retry with --force to force install it.

cpan 
install ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    there were errors, but I think it might have actually worked

brew reinstall ca-certificates
brew install openssl@3
brew reinstall openssl@1.1

cpanm Test::Deep

## ==> Caveats for openssl 3

A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl@3/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin/c_rehash

openssl@3 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@3 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile

For compilers to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig"

# Run these two to avoid "perl is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way" errors
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl\@1.1/1.1.1m/lib/libssl.dylib /usr/local/lib/libssl.dylib
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl\@1.1/1.1.1m/lib/libcrypto.dylib /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.dylib




9. install DBD::mysql
    I had a lot of trouble until I did this:

https://github-wiki-see.page/m/kyzn/PRC/wiki/Development-Instructions-%28macOS-Apple-Silicon%29
Run these two to avoid "perl is loading libcrypto in an unsafe way" errors
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl\@1.1/1.1.1m/lib/libssl.dylib /usr/local/lib/libssl.dylib
sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openssl\@1.1/1.1.1m/lib/libcrypto.dylib /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.dylib

    then, cpan worked:
cpan
install DBD::mysql
quit


xxxx perhaps install bioperl next

xxxx can I now install ensemblVEP?
