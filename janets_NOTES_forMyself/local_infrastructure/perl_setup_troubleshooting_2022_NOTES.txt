/usr/bin/perl -V
Summary of my perl5 (revision 5 version 26 subversion 1) configuration:





should I uninstall perl and my cpan modules?

should I load a module for perl in my login script, 
e.g. BioPerl/1.7.8-GCCcore-11.2.0      

/usr/bin/perl is 5.26.1


/home/jayoung/malik_lab_shared/linux_gizmo/bin/perl
/home/jayoung/malik_lab_shared/linux_gizmo/bin/perldoc

when I have env perl in the shebang, it does NOT find the perl modules I installed. 
when I have /usr/bin/perl, it DOES.


if a perl script shows me the source code rather than the pod documentation, that means it cannot find perldoc
