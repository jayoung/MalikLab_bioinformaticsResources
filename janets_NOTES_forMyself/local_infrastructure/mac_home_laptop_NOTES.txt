## I think I had the old laptop at this point:
Nov 30, 2020
------------

.profile is where my environmental variables are set

## perl stuff
perl (v5.18.4) and cpan (v1.61) are already installed 

# installed cpanm (cpan-minus, lightweight version)
cpan App::cpanminus
   (and allowed it to configure cpan automatically)

added this to my PATH, in .profile:
/Users/jayoung/perl5/bin

to install other modules I can do 
cpanm Module::Name

cpanm tips:
- cpanm suppresses a lot of (typically) irrelevant information. Sometimes when a module fails, you might want more information. There's a -v|--verbose flag that essentially shows you everything cpan would.
- some modules that require user input may seem to 'hang' when you try to install them. That's because the output that's asking you to type something is suppressed. You can use the --interactive (or --verbose) flags to work around that.



cpanm Bio::Seq


I may need to add to PERL5LIB

## this should be after I switched to the new 16" laptop:

Oct 2021
--------

changing some BBedit expert settings to try to not have bbedit freeze as often - I think it is to do with auo-save and docs found on remote servers:

https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/ExpertPreferences.html
https://groups.google.com/g/bbedit/

from Mac terminal command line:
defaults write com.barebones.bbedit EnableAutoSave_v2 -bool YES
defaults write com.barebones.bbedit AutoSaveIntervalInMinutes_v2 -int 30
defaults write com.barebones.bbedit DisableCtagsScanOnRemoteVolumes -bool YES
defaults write com.barebones.bbedit DisableSettingsScanOnRemoteVolumes -bool YES


Oct 13 2021
----------
for VScode:
cpanm Perl::LanguageServer.pm
cpanm Perl::LanguageServer::DebuggerInterface.pm

https://github.com/richterger/Perl-LanguageServer/issues/52
https://freesoft.dev/program/74304320

I need to have VScode read my PERL5LIB settings
I added this line to launch.json (found in .vscode directory of the master folder)
            "inc": "/Users/jayoung/perl5/lib/perl5"
            
There is also a file called settings.json here:
/Users/jayoung/Library/Application Support/Code/User
is that a location for universal launch settings?

https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings
VS Code provides two different scopes for settings:

User Settings - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
Workspace Settings - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.
Workspace settings override user settings. Workspace settings are specific to a project and can be shared across developers on a project.

in the extensions setting for the perl language server there is something called 
Perl: Path Map mapping of local to remote paths
that I would edit in the global settings.json file

Perl: Perl Inc
array with paths to add to perl library path. This setting is used by the syntax checker and for the debuggee and also for the LanguageServer itself. perl.perlInc should be absolute paths.

Gerald Richter is the author of the Perl extensions for VSCode:
https://github.com/richterger/
https://github.com/richterger/Perl-LanguageServer
https://github.com/richterger/vscode-perl-debug


https://github.com/richterger/Perl-LanguageServer/issues/52

But you can try what happens if you manually set your "env" variable, and include PERL5LIB in there (careful, the extension currently doesn't use a hash, but an array of key/value pairs).

perl -MPerl::LanguageServer -e 'print $INC{"Perl::LanguageServer.pm"}' or perldoc -l Perl::LanguageServer

echo 'print map { sprintf( "%20s : %s\n", $_, $INC{$_} ) } sort keys %INC; print "\n'$1' version : $'$1'::VERSION\n\n"' | perl "-M$1"
