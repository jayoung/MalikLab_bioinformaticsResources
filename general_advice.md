## Learning resources


Much more documentation [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/comp_index/).

The Hutch [‘Coop’](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/bdsc.html) Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative. This may be going away, sadly.

Some useful classes/courses available through fhcrc.io (some self-guided, some taught live)

Galaxy server https://usegalaxy.org/ 

The Hutch has access to a server called ‘globus’ https://fh.globusgenomics.org/ which is a bit like Galaxy. Not sure this is true any more.

## General advice
Keep good notes of what you've done! Think of it like a lab book. I often keep a file for each project (e.g. a gene of interest) of exactly what commands I've run, whether they worked or not). 

Give your files useful names so you can see how they were generated and what kind of file they are. It's easy to build up a ton of files - if they're all called temp1, temp2, etc, it'll get confusing when you come back next week. Unlike on a Mac, most programs will overwrite existing files if you reuse output file names - it won't ask you if you want to use a different name.

Like for labwork, positive/negative controls can be good, especially if you are confused about why something seemed like it didn't work.

Don't be frightened to try something out. A Google search with error messages can often easily help you figure out what's going on.
