# Repetitive regions, and how to analyze them 

Gene families, transposons, and other repeat types (e.g. satellites) are difficult to analyze.

## Technologies

Long reads (e.g. PacBio, Nanopore) are more uniquely mapable, but we usually get fewer reads. Short reads (Illumina) are more common for counting-based assays (e.g. RNA-seq with triplicates).
