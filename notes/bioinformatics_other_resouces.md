# Learning R

A [four-part course](https://fredhutchio.github.io/r_intro/) put together by Kate Hertweck (former Hutch instructor). I think it's good.  Was updated in 2020 - not sure it will continue to be updated, but not many of the basics change.

# Other lists of resources

A [list of courses/resources](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training) suggested by other Hutch people: includes Hutch stuff as well as resources elsewhere on the internet (scroll to the bottom)

The Hutch [‘Coop’](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/bdsc.html) Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative. Used to have staff whose job was training, but not any more, sadly. Website still has some teaching materials here. 

Some useful classes/courses available through [fhcrc.io](http://www.fredhutch.io) (some self-guided, some taught live)
