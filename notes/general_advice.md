# Bionformatics

## General advice
Keep good notes of what you've done! Think of it like a lab book. I often keep a file for each project (e.g. a gene of interest) of exactly what commands I've run, whether they worked or not). 

Give your files useful names so you can see how they were generated and what kind of file they are. It's easy to build up a ton of files - if they're all called temp1, temp2, etc, it'll get confusing when you come back next week. Unlike on a Mac, most programs will overwrite existing files if you reuse output file names - it won't ask you if you want to use a different name.

Like for labwork, positive/negative controls can be good, especially if you are confused about why something seemed like it didn't work.

Don't be frightened to try something out. A Google search with error messages can often easily help you figure out what's going on. 

There are usually many ways to do each task, many tools you could choose for each task. Often there's no one single "best" tool. Try to learn a little but about each tool's strengths and weaknesses, and a little bit about the parameters you might play with, but also don't overthink it.

With any tool, there's often a way to run it via a website, or via a graphical user interface like Geneious, or via the command-line. You choose!  But sometimes the command-line is the only way. It might be worth learning.

A **Galaxy server** is a web-based interface that can help you run many tools, using a web server interface rather than the command line. The 'original' Galaxy server is [here](https://usegalaxy.org/). There are also [other Galaxy servers](https://galaxyproject.org/use/) set up by groups with particular interests, where you may be able to find a different set of tools, e.g. [for Nanopore sequence analysis](https://nanopore.usegalaxy.eu)

The Hutch used to have access to a server called ‘globus’ https://fh.globusgenomics.org/ which is a bit like Galaxy, but I think this has gone away.

## Resources to learn computing/bioinformatics

Much more documentation on the Hutch resources [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/comp_index/).

The Hutch [‘Coop’](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/bdsc.html) Bioinformatics & Data Science Cooperative. Used to have staff whose job was training, but not any more, sadly. Website still has some teaching materials here. 

Some useful classes/courses available through [fhcrc.io](fhcrc.io) (some self-guided, some taught live)
