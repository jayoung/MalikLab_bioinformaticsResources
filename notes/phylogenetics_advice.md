## Miscellaneous notes

"Living fossil" species - gars and sturgeons have very low evolutionary rates (and some species diverged by >100My can even hybridize). Even lower than other "putative living fossils" including the tuatara, S. punctatus; the coelacanth, L. chalumnae; lungfishes; the elephant shark, Callorhinchus milii; and the hoatzin, O. hoazin  https://academic.oup.com/evolut/advance-article/doi/10.1093/evolut/qpae028/7615529
