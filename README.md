Repository to share bioinformatics teaching materials with the Malik lab. 

# Contents

I usually have in-person chats to help you learn these things, using these notes for reference:
- To learn how to use the [Hutch compute cluster](notes/FHCRC_compute_resources.md)
- To learn some [basic unix commands](notes/unix_intro.md)
- Some [general advice](notes/general_advice.md) on bioinformatics, and suggestions for where you might learn more
- Some [more advanced tricks](notes/FHCRC_compute_resources_advanced.md) for the Hutch compute cluster


# My own notes, on things I'm learning

I haven't necessarily written these in a way that others will be able to understand, but you're welcome to look through them if you like.

- learning about [docker containers and singularity](janets_NOTES_forMyself/docker_singularity_container_NOTES.md  )
