# MalikLab_bioinformaticsResources

Janet Young

A repository to share bioinformatics teaching materials with the Malik lab. 

Available via github, [here](https://github.com/jayoung/MalikLab_bioinformaticsResources).


WARNING - some of these files contain notes I put together for an individual project, some a long time ago. In many cases they're probably out-of-date: there might be better ways to do things now.

# Contents

I usually have in-person chats to help you learn these things, using these notes for reference:
- To learn how to use the [Hutch compute cluster](notes/FHCRC_compute_resources.md)
- To learn some [basic unix commands](notes/unix_intro.md)
- Some [general advice](notes/general_advice.md) on bioinformatics, and suggestions for where you might learn more
- Some [more advanced tricks](notes/FHCRC_compute_resources_advanced.md) for the Hutch compute cluster


# My own notes on things I'm learning

These are notes for myself - I probably haven't written these in a way that will be clear to others, but you're welcome to look through them if you like.
