# MalikLab_bioinformaticsResources

Janet Young

A repository to share bioinformatics teaching materials with the Malik lab. 

Available via github, [here](https://github.com/jayoung/MalikLab_bioinformaticsResources).

WARNING - some of these files contain notes I put together for an individual project, some a long time ago. In many cases they're probably out-of-date: there might be better ways to do things now.

# Requests/suggestions/feedback

Just let me know! You can talk to me, email me, or submit a github issue if that's your thing.

# Contents

I usually have in-person chats to help you learn these things, and we use these notes for reference. They might not make sense on their own.

- To learn how to use the [Hutch compute cluster](notes/FHCRC_compute_resources.md)
- To learn some [basic unix commands](notes/unix_intro.md)
- Some [general advice](notes/general_advice.md) on bioinformatics, and suggestions for where you might learn more
- Some [more advanced tricks](notes/FHCRC_compute_resources_advanced.md) for the Hutch compute cluster
- Notes on [transferring/copying large files](notes/file_transfer.md) from one computer to another
- Some [bioinformatics tools](notes/bioinformatics_tools.md) you can use via the command-line, especially blast and phyml.
- Some old notes on tools to analyze [deep sequencing data](notes/deep_sequencing.md). I think you'll get better information elsewhere.

# Other resources

There's a lot of material out there to help you learn bioinformatics, a lot of it better than anything I could put together.  

Some suggestions for tutorials, etc are [here](notes/bioinformatics_other_resources.md) - let me know if you have any you'd like to add.

Join the Hutch FH-Data/FH-BCR Slack workspace (old/new names for the same thing) - see instructions on joining [here](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/scicomputing/reference_training/). Once you're in, browse the channels for groups that interest you.   It's a great place to ask for help on anything from R coding to analysis strategies - very supportive community.

# PAML

We have a Dropbox folder called `PAML_class` with documents to help teach/learn PAML. If you don't already have access, let me know.   I might transfer those materials here at some point - will see how it goes sharing the other notes first. 

# My own notes on things I'm learning

These are notes for myself - I haven't written these in a way that will be clear to others, but you're welcome to look through them if you like.
